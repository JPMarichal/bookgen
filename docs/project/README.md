# Project Planning Documentation

This directory contains **project planning and design documents** (primarily in Spanish).

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
- **Project planning** and work plans
- **Requirements** specifications
- **Design proposals** and system architecture planning
- **Initial proposals** for major features

## Contents

### Planning Documents

- **PLAN_TRABAJO.md** - Work plan and project roadmap (Spanish)

- **PROPUESTA_GENERACION_AUTOMATICA_FUENTES.md** - Automatic source generation proposal (Spanish)
- **SISTEMA_GENERACION_FUENTES_ALTA_CALIDAD.md** - High-quality source generation system (Spanish)

## Language

Most documents in this directory are in **Spanish** as they were created during initial project planning.

## Usage

⚠️ **Note**: These are **planning documents** that informed the implementation but may not reflect the exact current state.

For current documentation, see:
- [User Guides](../user-guide/) - How to use current features
- [Architecture](../architecture/) - Current system design
- [Getting Started](../getting-started/) - Setup and configuration

## Relationship to Implementation

These planning docs led to:
- Automatic source generation features (see [AUTO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md](../guides/AUTO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md))
- Source validation system (see root `ADVANCED_SOURCE_VALIDATION.md`)
- Quality control features (see root `*_VALIDATION_*.md` files)
