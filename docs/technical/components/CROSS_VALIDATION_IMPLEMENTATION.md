# Cross-Validation System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive cross-validation system for ensuring factual consistency and quality across multiple biographical sources. This addresses Issue #64.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Models (`src/api/models/cross_validation.py`)
- **ValidationResult**: Comprehensive validation result with all quality metrics
- **RedundancyAnalysis**: Analysis of information redundancy across sources
- **AcademicStandards**: Academic compliance and quality assessment
- **KeyFact**: Structured representation of extracted facts
- **TemporalCoverage**: Analysis of temporal coverage across life periods

### 2. Fact Checker (`src/utils/fact_checker.py`)
- **FactualConsistencyChecker**: AI-powered fact extraction and consistency verification
  - Extracts key facts from content using OpenRouter AI
  - Compares facts between sources for consistency
  - Fallback mechanisms for robustness
  - Support for categorizing facts (dates, events, achievements, etc.)

### 3. Source Triangulator (`src/utils/source_triangulator.py`)
- **SourceTriangulator**: Cross-reference and triangulation of multiple sources
  - Triangulates facts across multiple sources
  - Calculates source overlap and diversity
  - Detects redundancy in information
  - Analyzes source type, domain, and author diversity

### 4. Cross-Validation System (`src/services/cross_validator.py`)
- **CrossValidationSystem**: Main orchestrator for cross-validation
  - Checks factual consistency across sources
  - Analyzes temporal coverage (early life, career, later years, legacy)
  - Calculates source diversity
  - Detects information redundancy
  - Verifies academic standards compliance
  - Generates improvement recommendations
  - Calculates overall quality score

## Key Features

### Factual Consistency Checking
- AI-powered extraction of key facts from each source
- Pairwise comparison of facts between sources
- Consistency matrix building and scoring
- Identification of contradictions and agreements

### Temporal Coverage Analysis
- Detection of life period coverage:
  - Early life and education
  - Career and professional development
  - Later years and retirement
  - Legacy and impact
- Identification of temporal gaps

### Source Diversity Assessment
- Source type diversity (books, articles, documents)
- Domain diversity (different institutions)
- Author diversity (different perspectives)
- Weighted diversity scoring

### Redundancy Detection
- Domain-based overlap calculation
- Unique vs. redundant source identification
- Information uniqueness ratio
- Recommendations for removing redundant sources

### Academic Standards Verification
- Peer-reviewed source counting
- Academic domain detection
- Primary source identification
- Citation quality assessment
- Compliance scoring and issue reporting

### Recommendation Generation
- Context-aware improvement suggestions
- Specific threshold-based recommendations
- Actionable guidance for source set improvement

## Acceptance Criteria âœ…

All acceptance criteria from Issue #64 are met:

```python
validator = CrossValidationSystem()
result = validator.validate_source_set_quality(sources, "Einstein")

assert result.consistency_score >= 0.8      # âœ“ PASS
assert result.temporal_coverage >= 0.7      # âœ“ PASS
assert result.redundancy_level <= 0.3       # âœ“ PASS
assert len(result.recommendations) > 0      # âœ“ PASS
```

## Usage Example

```python
from src.services.cross_validator import CrossValidationSystem
from src.strategies.base_strategy import SourceCandidate

# Initialize the system
validator = CrossValidationSystem()

# Prepare sources
sources = [
    SourceCandidate(...),
    SourceCandidate(...),
    # ... more sources
]

# Validate source set
result = validator.validate_source_set_quality(sources, "Albert Einstein")

# Access results
print(f"Consistency: {result.consistency_score:.2f}")
print(f"Temporal Coverage: {result.temporal_coverage:.2f}")
print(f"Diversity: {result.diversity_score:.2f}")
print(f"Redundancy: {result.redundancy_level:.2f}")
print(f"Academic Compliance: {result.academic_compliance:.2f}")
print(f"Overall Quality: {result.overall_quality:.2f}")

# Get recommendations
for rec in result.recommendations:
    print(f"- {rec}")
```

## Demo Scripts

### Run the Demo
```bash
python3 examples/demo_cross_validation.py
```

### Verify Acceptance Criteria
```bash
python3 scripts/verification/verify_cross_validation.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_cross_validation.py -v
```

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- **OpenRouterClient**: AI-powered fact extraction and comparison
- **SourceCandidate**: Source representation from base strategy
- **SourceItem**: Source metadata model

### Fallback Mechanisms
- If AI is unavailable, uses heuristic-based fact extraction
- Graceful degradation with reasonable default scores
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Quality Metrics

### Weighting Formula
```python
overall_quality = (
    consistency_score * 0.30 +
    temporal_coverage * 0.20 +
    diversity_score * 0.20 +
    (1 - redundancy_level) * 0.15 +
    academic_compliance * 0.15
)
```

### Thresholds
- **Consistency**: â‰¥ 0.8 (recommended)
- **Temporal Coverage**: â‰¥ 0.7 (recommended)
- **Redundancy**: â‰¤ 0.3 (recommended)
- **Academic Compliance**: Variable based on source type

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Enhanced AI models for better fact extraction
2. Support for multi-language sources
3. Citation graph analysis
4. Chronological consistency checking
5. Geographic coverage analysis
6. Subject matter expert validation
7. Real-time source quality monitoring
