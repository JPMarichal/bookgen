# Test Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes and optimizations made to resolve test failures and improve test execution performance.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ZipExportService Test Failures (5 tests)
**Error:** `AttributeError: 'ZipExportService' object has no attribute 'bios_dir'`

**Root Cause:**
- Tests in `test_download_output_endpoint.py` were monkeypatching `ZipExportService.__init__` twice
- The second monkeypatch (in individual test methods) was overriding the working patch from `setup_test_data` fixture
- The broken lambda tried to access `self.bios_dir` which doesn't exist

**Fix:**
- Removed redundant monkeypatch calls from 5 test methods:
  - `test_download_output_success`
  - `test_download_output_normalizes_character_name`
  - `test_download_output_filename_format`
  - `test_download_output_zip_contains_all_directories`
  - `test_download_output_valid_zip_file`
- The `setup_test_data` fixture already properly patches `ZipExportService.__init__`

**Files Changed:**
- `tests/test_download_output_endpoint.py`

### 2. WordExporter Test Failure (1 test)
**Error:** `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app'`

**Root Cause:**
- `word_exporter.py` hardcoded `/app/bios` as the base path for output files
- Tests run in temporary directories without access to `/app`
- Code failed when trying to create output directories

**Fix:**
- Made output path derivation dynamic based on input markdown file path
- When "bios" is in the path: derive base from the input file's path structure
- When "bios" is not in the path: create output relative to input file's directory
- Maintains production behavior while supporting test environments

**Files Changed:**
- `src/services/word_exporter.py`

## Performance Optimization

### Problem
Test suite was taking ~25 minutes to execute, causing:
- Slow feedback loop for pull requests
- Decreased developer productivity
- Delayed CI/CD pipeline completion

### Solution
Implemented multi-pronged optimization strategy:

#### 1. Slow Test Marking
Added `pytestmark = pytest.mark.slow` to performance and stress test modules:
- `tests/performance/test_api_performance.py` (11 benchmark tests)
- `tests/stress/test_stress.py` (10 stress tests)
- `tests/integration/test_biography_generation.py` (marked as integration)

#### 2. Parallel Test Execution
- Added `pytest-xdist` dependency for parallel test execution
- Updated GitHub workflow to use `-n auto` flag
- Tests now run in parallel across available CPU cores

#### 3. Selective Test Execution
- Updated CI/CD pipeline to skip slow tests by default: `-m "not slow"`
- 565 of 586 tests run by default (21 slow tests excluded)
- Slow tests can be run separately on-demand or scheduled

### Results
- **Execution Time:** Reduced from ~25 minutes to ~5-10 minutes
- **Test Coverage:** Maintained (all functional tests still run)
- **Flexibility:** Slow tests available for comprehensive testing when needed

### Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Updated test execution with parallel runs and slow test filtering
- `tests/README.md` - Added performance optimization documentation
- `tests/performance/test_api_performance.py` - Added slow marker
- `tests/stress/test_stress.py` - Added slow marker
- `tests/integration/test_biography_generation.py` - Added integration marker

## Testing Commands

### Run tests (excluding slow tests, with parallel execution):
```bash
pytest -m "not slow" -n auto
```

### Run tests with coverage:
```bash
pytest -m "not slow" -n auto --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Run only slow tests:
```bash
pytest -m slow -v
```

### Run all tests (including slow):
```bash
pytest -n auto
```

### Run specific failing tests (now fixed):
```bash
pytest tests/test_download_output_endpoint.py -v
pytest tests/test_word_export.py::TestWordExporter::test_export_to_word_with_toc -v
```

## Verification

All previously failing tests now pass:
- ✅ `test_download_output_success`
- ✅ `test_download_output_normalizes_character_name`
- ✅ `test_download_output_filename_format`
- ✅ `test_download_output_zip_contains_all_directories`
- ✅ `test_download_output_valid_zip_file`
- ✅ `test_export_to_word_with_toc`

Test execution statistics:
- **Total tests:** 586
- **Fast tests (default run):** 565
- **Slow tests (optional):** 21
- **Execution time (fast):** ~5-10 minutes
- **Execution time (all):** ~15-20 minutes

## Recommendations

1. **For Developers:**
   - Use `pytest -m "not slow" -n auto` for local testing
   - Run slow tests before major releases: `pytest -m slow`

2. **For CI/CD:**
   - Keep current configuration (fast tests on every PR)
   - Consider scheduled nightly runs of slow tests
   - Add optional workflow for comprehensive testing

3. **For Future:**
   - Continue marking compute-intensive tests as slow
   - Consider additional categories (database, external, etc.)
   - Monitor test execution times and optimize as needed
