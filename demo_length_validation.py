    Albert Einstein revolutionized physics with his theory of relativity.
    His groundbreaking work fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time.
    
    The special theory of relativity, published in 1905, introduced revolutionary concepts.
    Time dilation and length contraction challenged classical Newtonian mechanics.
    Einstein's famous equation, E=mc¬≤, demonstrated mass-energy equivalence.
    
    General relativity, completed in 1915, explained gravity as curved spacetime.
    Massive objects bend the fabric of space and time around them.
    This elegant theory predicted phenomena like gravitational lensing and black holes.
    
    Einstein's contributions extended far beyond relativity theory alone.
    His work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in 1921.
    He made fundamental advances in quantum mechanics and statistical physics.
    
    The scientific community initially resisted some of Einstein's radical ideas.
    However, experimental evidence gradually confirmed his theoretical predictions.
    Today, GPS satellites and particle accelerators rely on relativistic corrections.
    
    Einstein's philosophical views on science influenced generations of researchers.
    He believed in the power of thought experiments and mathematical beauty.
    His legacy continues to inspire physicists exploring the frontiers of knowledge.
    
    Beyond science, Einstein became an advocate for peace and social justice.
    He spoke out against nuclear weapons and supported civil rights movements.
    His humanitarian efforts reflected his deep concern for humanity's future.

Example usage:

This will:
1. Read bios/albert_einstein/control/longitudes.csv
2. Validate each section file (capitulo-01.md, capitulo-02.md, etc.)
3. Calculate quality metrics for each section
4. Update the CSV with actual word counts and percentages
5. Return detailed validation results for each section

The CSV format remains compatible with check_lengths.py:
